			<h1>One Of My Story</h1>
			<p>
			<body>
			 		 	When I was in middle school, I have some best friends. We alwasys <br />
						go out on friday night and have fun together during the weekend.<br />
						As time goes by, we go to high school but we are not in the same high school.<br />
						The connection between us is getting less and less.<br />
						Druing the high school, we can meet each other once in a few months.<br />
						But I never think that the brotherhood between us are decreased.<br />
						Now, I study in the United States, all of my best friends are in China.<br />
						We can hardly meet maybe 1 or 2 years.
						But everytime I go back to my hometown,<br />
						we always hungout just like what we do in the middle school. I really miss my best friedns.<br />
				   <p>
					</p>
					  Next year, one of my best firend is going to get married with his lover,
						 we really feel happy for him. <br />
						 I told them this winter holiday that I will come to the wedding ceremony no matter how busy I am.<br />
					   It seems all of my best friends have their girlfriends, I really feel happy for them.<br />
						 And also, I think I need to work hard to find my girlfriend. LOL.
